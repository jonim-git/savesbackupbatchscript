Emulator saves progress (batch format ver). Shell format script originally done by [Christian Legge](https://github.com/christianlegge/).

**Usage:**

- Edit folder paths, time format, etc., in the script and save as a `.bat` file.
- Edit `.gitignore` as well once you've made your own repo for save files
- Create a Basic Task in Windows Task Scheduler, run a script with it and make it run as often you want
